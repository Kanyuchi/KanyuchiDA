Important NOTEs for the teacher: 

- only the code_along lecture is ready
- the self_guided is the NF old curriculum version it is so wordy and tied in details it would require some extra time to untie the logic and adapt to the pipeline schedule.
might be easier to write a new version (similar to code_along?)
